Drop Down;Know Yourself;What is Learning?;Text;;
Drop Down;Know Yourself;;Text;Learning is the acquisition of new skills, knowledge, understanding  and attitude and the recognition of how they relate to what you already have.;
Drop Down;Know Yourself;;Text;Learning is a process of self-development. You learn best when you relate the new to your previous and current experience.;
Drop Down;Know Yourself;;Text;Learning is not just collecting information, it is engaging with that information in a creative way.;
Drop Down;Know Yourself;;Text;Don’t expect to be “taught”, expect to have to “Learn.” We will provide all the materials, opportunities to engage with and discuss the information and provide assessment and feedback, but YOU have to do the learning!;
Drop Down;Know Yourself;;Text;"As you have seen in the previous chapter “What is elearning” Online learning is mostly about cognitive learning. This is to do with thinking abilities; comprehending, understanding, that is, what you know and what you do with what you know.";

Drop Down;Know Yourself;The Characteristics of Distance learning;Text;;This is a heading.  User larger font in purple
Drop Down;Know Yourself;;Text;Learn by doing:;
Drop Down;Know Yourself;;Text;Complete the activities asked of you. Engage with the material. Make the effort to contribute to forums, chat rooms and discussion groups.;
Drop Down;Know Yourself;;Text;Learn by assessment:;
Drop Down;Know Yourself;;Text;You will have short SUMMATIVE tests at the end of every lesson or unit. these will give you a snap shot of your knowledge. Sometimes you will be required to SELF ASSESS. In other words you will be given the answer to a task (sometimes called a mark scheme or memo). FORMATIVE assessment is offered where feedback is given, you must reflect on this feedback if you are going to learn from it.;
Drop Down;Know Yourself;;Text;Learning by feedback:;
Drop Down;Know Yourself;;Text;Some assessments will be marked by the course tutor and returned to you with feedback. This is written advice on how to improve your understanding. READ IT! Think about it, communicate with the course tutor about it, ask questions and take ownership for your learning. Feedback is also motivation as it will show you where you are doing well!;
Drop Down;Know Yourself;;Text;Learning by attending STUDY DAYS and WORKSHOPS:;
Drop Down;Know Yourself;;Text;Guerilla Teachers provide students with opportunities for face-to-face meetings to focus on areas needing development. To identify misconceptions and develop overall competence in a particular subject or unit.;
Drop Down;Know Yourself;;Text;Take control of your own learning.;
Drop Down;Know Yourself;;Text;This is the big one! With distance learning you take far more responsibility for your own learning than in a traditional taught course. YOU have to meet the deadlines, YOU have to keep motivated and YOU have to balance work and play. Ultimately what you put in determines what you get out.;
Drop Down;Know Yourself;;Text;Learning by reflection:;
Drop Down;Know Yourself;;Text;The most effective learning comes when time to reflect on what you have learned is built into your study time.;
Drop Down;Know Yourself;;Text;Taking ownership of your learning requires that you THINK about what you have learned, DISCUSS it with your tutor and fellow students.;
Drop Down;Know Yourself;The Learning Process;Text;;This is a heading.  User larger font in purple
Drop Down;Know Yourself;;Text;Learning is NOT PASSIVE! What you DO with the information once you have accessed it determines your understanding of it and your ability to recall it.;

Drop Down;Know Yourself;;Text;Learning does not happen in STRAIGHT LINES! Kolb was a chap who is credited with describing this best in his “Learning Cycle”. But in order to avoid words like “abstract conceptualization” here is an image found on the internet that explains it very well.;

Drop Down;Know Yourself;;;An idea is never really clear until you apply it…;
Drop Down;Know Yourself;;;You don`t know how well it worked until you think about it or you discuss it with someone else…;
Drop Down;Know Yourself;;;You then try and improve on it and try it out again…;
Drop Down;Know Yourself;;;It may not be smooth, it may take a long time and where you start in the cycle is entirely up to you…are you an activist (do it), a reflector (think about it), a theorist (work out why) or a pragmatist (make it work) ? BUT as the cycle must be complete you should aim to develop all aspects of learning.;
