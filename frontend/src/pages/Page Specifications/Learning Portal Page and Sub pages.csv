"Special global (master) page instructions:  This template is the specification for the master, or  landing page of ""The Learning Portal"".  It has two subpages called ""International GCSE and International AS Levels.  These two sub pages each has one sub page called ""Courses"". All five pages have their own unique content.  The general structure of the Learning Portal master page is as follows:  It has three segments, one above the other, across the page width.  The top segment has an image with some text superimposed on it, on the right-hand side of the image, so as not to obscure a student studying at her desk, appearing on the left in the image.  This text should not obscure the image in the background - the applicable text box should be transparent. When a user launches this page, the image must fill the entire, initial, visible area of the browser.  When scrolling down to view more content, the user sees that the image has a curve at the bottom, as though a large circle is rising into it from the bottom.  This imaginary ""circle” is large enough for its effect to be visible from the left to the right of the image, but it only enters about 10% of the total image height.  In the table below, the column heading ""Page Type"" provides the name of the page.  The data below the page ""type title"" is the content for that segment, not any of the segments above that one.  The ""Page Title"" column states the name of each of the three segments.  Any text, images or videos below the Pae Title, is relevant to that segment only. The third segment contains two similar entities.  The top one is a """"testimonials"" area, where three testimonials of studens runs in ""ticker"" format, appearing from fight, moving to the left, replacing the previous testimonia.  Every testimonial remains visible (pauses) for about 6 seconds.  Below the testimonials are two images, also rolling in from right to left.  Superimposed (in transparent text boxes) are wording advertising the two solutions offered on the sub pages.  Both the above can be ""grabbed"" by the user by ""clicking"" on the text or image to hold and move at own pace.  A comment or question from me is whether these ""tickers"" are placed at the correct part of the page.  Should, for instance, the testimonials not appear higher up?";;;;;;
