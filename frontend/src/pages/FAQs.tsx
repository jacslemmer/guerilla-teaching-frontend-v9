    question: 'Whats the difference between Pearson and Cambridge?',
    answer: [
      'They are BOTH accredited examination boards of the United Kingdom. The are BOTH accredited by USAf and SAQA for the purposes of Matric Exemption. They are BOTH accepted by Universities in South Africa and World Wide. Pearson offers some subjects Cambridge does not and vice versa. Not all exams with Pearson are offered in both May and November examination sessions. Pearson IAS Science subjects DO NOT REQUIRE PRACTICAL EXAMS. It is understood by many in education that Pearson examinations have a more practical, straightforward and applied approach, compared to Cambridge\'s more theoretical approach.',

      'You cannot spread your examinations out over too long a time period.',
      'The simplest way to see if you are within the rule is to consider the EARLIEST date and the MOST RECENT date on the certificates you submit to USAf for the purpose of Matric Exemption. There should be no more than 24 months between these two dates, including resits.'
    ]
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I mix and Match Pearson and Cambridge for my Matric Exam?',
    answer: [
      'Yes. International schools all offer a mix of examination boards (from AQA and OCR to Pearson and Cambridge). It is only in South Africa that schools offer only one or the other.'
