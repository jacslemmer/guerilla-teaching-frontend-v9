            <p>
              Learning should meet the individual needs of each child. Children are entering a rapidly changing world and the knowledge they acquire today is different from the skills they will need when they leave school â€“ therefore they must be inspired to become life-long learners. So learning how to learn, to be creative, experiment, communicate, disseminate, take responsibility, work together, exchange and respectfully discuss opinions are some of the competences we seek to develop.
